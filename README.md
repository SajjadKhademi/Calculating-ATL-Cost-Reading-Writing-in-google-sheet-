Calculating share of SnappFood's bilboards cost based on days in month.
In this case we got just satrting date of promotions and the end date in each city.
I used gspread module to reading data from marketing department and pygsheet to writing on google sheet.(it was better to use just pygsheet to read and write)
I got a file named secret_key.json that I created GoogleSheetReading project in console.cloud.google.com/apis/credintials to allow me write and read in google sheet by client e-mail in json file.
There is just need to add that email in google sheets that needs to read or write.
